{"id":"lxl-hor","title":"Add bits-ui and use those components to make the over all UI better","description":"Welcome to Bits UI, a collection of headless component primitives for Svelte 5 that prioritizes developer experience, accessibility, and flexibility. This guide will help you quickly integrate Bits UI into your Svelte application.\n\nInstallation\nInstall bits using your preferred package manager.\n\nnpm install bits-ui\nBasic Usage\nAfter installation, you can import and use Bits UI components in your Svelte files. Here's a simple example using the Accordion component.\n\n\u003cscript lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n  import { Accordion } from \"bits-ui\";\n\u003c/script\u003e\n \n\u003cAccordion.Root type=\"single\"\u003e\n  \u003cAccordion.Item value=\"item-1\"\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Header\u003e\n      \u003cAccordion.Trigger\u003eItem 1 Title\u003c/Accordion.Trigger\u003e\n    \u003c/Accordion.Header\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Content\n      \u003eThis is the collapsible content for this section.\u003c/Accordion.Content\n    \u003e\n  \u003c/Accordion.Item\u003e\n  \u003cAccordion.Item value=\"item-2\"\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Header\u003e\n      \u003cAccordion.Trigger\u003eItem 2 Title\u003c/Accordion.Trigger\u003e\n    \u003c/Accordion.Header\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Content\n      \u003eThis is the collapsible content for this section.\u003c/Accordion.Content\n    \u003e\n  \u003c/Accordion.Item\u003e\n\u003c/Accordion.Root\u003e\nAdding Styles\nBits UI components are headless by design, meaning they ship with minimal styling. This gives you complete control over the appearance of your components. Each component that renders an HTML element exposes a class prop and style prop that you can use to apply styles to the element.\n\nStyling with TailwindCSS or UnoCSS\nIf you're using a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or UnoCSS, you can pass the classes directly to the components:\n\n\u003cscript lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n  import { Accordion } from \"bits-ui\";\n\u003c/script\u003e\n \n\u003cAccordion.Root class=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-md\"\u003e\n  \u003cAccordion.Item class=\"mb-2 rounded-md border border-gray-200\"\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Header class=\"bg-gray-50 transition-colors hover:bg-gray-100\"\u003e\n      \u003cAccordion.Trigger\n        class=\"flex w-full items-center justify-between p-4 text-left font-medium\"\n      \u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003eTailwind-styled Accordion\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003csvg\n          class=\"h-5 w-5 transform transition-transform\"\n          xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n          fill=\"none\"\n          viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n          stroke=\"currentColor\"\n        \u003e\n          \u003cpath\n            stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n            stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n            stroke-width=\"2\"\n            d=\"M19 9l-7 7-7-7\"\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/svg\u003e\n      \u003c/Accordion.Trigger\u003e\n    \u003c/Accordion.Header\u003e\n    \u003cAccordion.Content class=\"p-4 text-gray-700\"\u003e\n      This accordion is styled using Tailwind CSS classes.\n    \u003c/Accordion.Content\u003e\n  \u003c/Accordion.Item\u003e\n\u003c/Accordion.Root\u003e\nStyling with Data Attributes\nEach Bits UI component applies specific data attributes to the underlying HTML elements. You can use these attributes to target components in your global styles:\n\nCheck the API Reference for each component to determine its data attributes\nUse those attributes in your CSS selectors\n+layout.svelte\n\u003cscript lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n  import { Button } from \"bits-ui\";\n  import \"../app.css\";\n\u003c/script\u003e\n \n\u003cButton.Root\u003eClick me\u003c/Button.Root\u003e\napp.css\n[data-button-root] {\n  height: 3rem;\n  width: 100%;\n  background-color: #3182ce;\n  color: white;\n  border-radius: 0.375rem;\n  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\n  font-weight: 500;\n}\n \n[data-button-root]:hover {\n  background-color: #2c5282;\n}\nWith this approach, every Button.Root component will have these styles applied to it automatically.\n\nTypeScript Support\nBits UI is built with TypeScript and provides comprehensive type definitions. When using TypeScript, you'll get full type checking and autocompletion:\n\n\u003cscript lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n  import { Accordion } from \"bits-ui\";\n \n  // TypeScript will validate these props\n  const accordionMultipleProps: Accordion.RootProps = {\n    type: \"multiple\",\n    value: [\"item-1\"], // type error if value is not an array\n  };\n \n  const accordionSingleProps: Accordion.RootProps = {\n    type: \"single\",\n    value: \"item-1\", // type error if value is an array\n  };\n\u003c/script\u003e\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-03T13:40:14.718566-05:00","created_by":"brendan","updated_at":"2026-01-03T13:40:14.718566-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lxl-hor","depends_on_id":"lxl-192","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-03T13:40:44.305963-05:00","created_by":"brendan"}]}
